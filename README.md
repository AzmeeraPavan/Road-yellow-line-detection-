Video Reading: The script reads a video file frame by frame.

Preprocessing: Each frame is preprocessed by applying a Gaussian blur and converting the frame to the HSV color space for better color representation.

Color Isolation: A binary mask is created to isolate yellow color in the frame, which is assumed to represent road lines.

Edge Detection: Canny edge detection is applied to the masked frame to identify edges.

Line Detection: The Hough Transform is used to detect lines in the edge-detected frame.

Visualization: The original frame with detected lines and the edge-detected frame are displayed.
